# Inst-414-project
For our project we wanted to focus on how we can help best inform people about youth tobacco use and what the diffrent ccorrealations between different 
varibales in the dataset and how that has a correaltion to youth tabacco use. What we have done is allow users to compare differnet variables and see what the higest correlation is using a heatmap.
the way the code is essentially supossed to run is the user is given a list of the columns in the dataset and they can compare 2 or more columns to see the correalation between them.
